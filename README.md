I am a motivated, team-work oriented, and responsible Data Scientist and Water Manager with seven years of practical experience in Machine Learning and predictive modeling of complex data, which includes handling the whole pipeline from preprocessing of data tothe visualization of results. I am highly proficient in SQL and in programming languages such as R and Python, and have an open mind-set and a commitment to continuous learning and professional development. 

For the last seven years, I have been working at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries where I have been responsible for analysis of big data using machine and deep learning tools to assess predictive power of featureparameters or influencing factors and define the potential future scopes with implications for environmental management. I have also been responsible for contributing to talking about data and thriving on explaining the meaning of data by providing easily interpretable outcomes (e.g., interactive dashboards, reports and deliverables) for either my fellow colleagues or managers and non-technical stakeholders. 

I have the initiative, enthusiasm and willingness to learn new skills and keep abreast of and promote new developments in the appropriate professional field. Thanks to my migration background and my experience of studying and working in different countries (Iran, The Netherlands and Germany) I have become very flexible and able to adapt to differentworking environments while communicating in different languages, which I really enjoy.

Here I work on a variety of kaggle competitions and would like to distribute my competitive solutions, so people might come up with potential ways of solving real-life tasks. The good news is that I anounce my solutions in both R and python environments. Yaaaay!

The first project I am working on is the "Appliances Energy Use AEU". The AEU includes high resolution data that is recorded at 10-minute frequencies for roughly 4.5 months. The recorded feature parameters are temperature (11 parameters), relative  humidity (10 parameters), lights, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility. According to the project descriptions, the house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters). You can download the data under the following Kaggle repository: https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/appliances-energy-prediction.

To follow the whole pipeline from preprocessing of data to the visualization of the results, I prepared an interractive shiny web application which includes all the scripts and visualized outcomes. I will update this read me file as well as the dashboard once I have solutions for further projects. Enjoy scrolling through the interractive dashboard!

You may download the repository and run the Shiny app in R/RStudio on your local system, or run the following commands in your Terminal or R console:
```
# Terminal: 
runGitHub('KaranHub','KaranKakouei')

# R-console: 
shiny::runGitHub('KaranHub','KaranKakouei')
```
